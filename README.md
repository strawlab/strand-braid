# Strand-Braid

[![User's Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-User's%20Guide-blue.svg?logo=Gitbook)](https://strawlab.github.io/strand-braid/)

## Description

[Strand Camera](https://strawlab.org/strand-cam/) is low-latency camera
acquisition and tracking software. It is useful for 2D tracking of animals,
robots, or other moving objects. It also serves as the basis for 3D tracking
using Braid.

[Braid](https://strawlab.org/braid/) is multi-camera acquisition and tracking
software. It is useful for 3D tracking of animals, robots, or other moving
objects. It operates with low latency and is suitable for closed-loop
experimental systems such as [virtual reality for freely moving
animals](https://strawlab.org/freemovr/).

This repository is a mono repository that houses the source code for both pieces
of software as well as many other related pieces, mostly written as Rust crates.

Users, as opposed to developers, of this software should refer to the
[strand-braid-user directory](strand-braid-user) which contains user
documentation and scripts for interacting with the software and performing data
analysis.

## Installing

Please see the [Installation section of our User
Guide](https://strawlab.github.io/strand-braid/installation.html).

## Building for Development

### Prerequisites

[Install rust](https://rustup.rs/).

[Install trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/#install)

Install your camera drivers. Currently Basler Pylon and Allied Vision Vimba are
supported.

First checkout the git repository into a location which will below be called
`/path/to/strand-braid`:

```
cd /path/to # <---- change this to a suitable filesystem directory
git clone https://github.com/strawlab/strand-braid
cd strand-braid # now in /path/to/strand-braid
```

### Strand Camera

First, build the browser user interface (BUI) for Strand Camera. This will build
files in `strand-cam/yew_frontend/dist` which get included in the Strand Cam
executable:

```
cd /path/to/strand-braid/strand-cam/yew_frontend
trunk build
```

Then, build the Strand Cam executable for Basler cameras using the Pylon
drivers, which must be preinstalled:

```
cd /path/to/strand-braid/strand-cam/strand-cam-pylon
cargo build --release
# By default, the executable will be put in /path/to/strand-braid/target/release/strand-cam-pylon
```

Alternatively or additionally, build the Strand Cam executable for Allied Vision
cameras using the Vimba drivers, which must be preinstalled:

```
cd /path/to/strand-braid/strand-cam/strand-cam-vimba
cargo build --release
# By default, the executable will be put in /path/to/strand-braid/target/release/strand-cam-vimba
```

Many compile-time options exist to adjust the exact features used, but the
instructions above should build a working copy of Strand Camera albeit with
potentially reduced features and performance.

### Braid

We will build `braid-run` which is the main runtime application we call "Braid".

First, build the browser user interface (BUI) for Braid. This will build files
in `braid/braid-run/braid_frontend/pkg` which get included in the `braid-run`
executable:

```
cd /path/to/strand-braid/braid/braid-run/braid_frontend
wasm-pack build --target web
```

Then, build the `braid-run` executable:

```
cd /path/to/strand-braid/braid/braid-run
cargo build --release
# By default, the executable will be put in /path/to/strand-braid/target/release/braid-run
```
