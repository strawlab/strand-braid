### Cameras

Currently only Basler cameras are supported. We use Basler's Pylon library to
access the cameras.

Support for other cameras is planned.

### Trigger box

Braid uses the [Straw Lab Triggerbox](https://github.com/strawlab/triggerbox)
hardware to synchronize the cameras. This is based on an Arduino
microcontroller.

### Trigger cables

TODO: write this and describe how to check everything is working.
